in order to create frontend we will create react app using npx create-react-app then we need to create some components
like signup and login
to create routes we require
react-router-dom   then wrap browserrouter to app

//

# sign Up 
for signup we require email,pass,name  create form for this give value to it and also onchange and create state for each also using usestate and also create a button on submit it we should make post request
and if i do not use form then i need to use onclick there
now connecting fe to be using fetch it will take method , headers, body
after submit we will get cors error beacuse our frontend is running on 3000 and backend is on 4500 to avoid this we need to use cors
app.use(cors()) in our backend index.js  
earlier it was not working beacuse i was not using correct link ====> http://localhost:4500/users/register


# login
exact similar thing need to be done for login also...
now we need to save the token inside localstorage

# createNotePage

create AddNote.jsx
we require title,body,category copy paste these things and changed states
create same handlesubmit and fetch just change the url notes/create
one things we need which is token
we can pass the token inside headers authorization:`Bearer ${localstorage.getitem('token')}`

# displaying note note.jsx





















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
